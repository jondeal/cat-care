    <h1>Entertaining the Little Monsters</h1>
    <p>If you feel like playing with them actively, there is a bird-on-a-string in the cabinet under the doll diorama.</p>
    <p>If you want to let them pick which toys to play with on their own time, you can take the blue box of cat toys off the right bookshelf 
        and leave it open on the floor for them.
