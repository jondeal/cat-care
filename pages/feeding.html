    <h1>Food</h1>
    <p>Once a day is the easiest.  The time doesn't really matter; they're fat little fatties and will love it regardless.</p>
    <p>Peridot is a tyrant and thinks whatever food is served first is his, so I feed him first.  His feeding zone is near the far kitchen wall.</p>
    <p>Topaz's feeding zone is near the dishwasher.</p>
    <h2>Dry Food</h2>
    <p>The container will be obvious.  One heaping scoop of dry kibble per kitten per day.</p>
    <h2>Wet Food</h2>
    <p>Small spoons work best.  The scale will be on the counter if you would like to use it.</p>
    <p>Split one box roughly evenly between them; don't worry about being that precise.  The scale kind of sucks anyway.  Fuck you, 
        Kitchen Kaboodle, with your lack of in-stock variety.</p>
    <h3>Cat√© Texture</h3>
    <p>Approx. 180g per kitten.</p>
    <h3>Minced Texture</h3>
    <p>Approx. 175g per kitten.</p>
    <h3>Distracting the Beast</h3>
    <p>Peridot usually finishes first and must be distracted with the food box remnants, as you saw.  Red scissors, snipping longways up each side 
        and "clamshell"-ing is my preferred method.

    <h1>Water</h1>
    <p>Dump in sink, rinse bowl with hot, fill to line with cold.</p>
