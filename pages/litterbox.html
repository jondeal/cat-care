    <h1>My Least-Mess, Least-Hassle Litterbox Routine</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the kitchen trashcan to the bathroom and place near tub.</li>
        <li>Pull litterbox away from the wall and alongside the trashcan.  Scoop is behind litterbox, tucked under weird heater thing.</li>
        <li>Open litterbox by tilting lid upward 90 degrees and removing lid.</li>
        <li>For best results and minimal spillage, sit on tub facing litterbox.</li>
        <li>Scoop!</li>
        <li>Reverse Steps 1-3.</li>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>Profit!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Pee Zones:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Big buried clumps in upper left (as seen from tub-seat), fairly easy to get without breaking</li>
            <li>Sloppy half-buried clumps in upper right and lower right, may take some covering and edgewise finesse scrape-scooping to keep 
                intact-ish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Poop Zones:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Anywhere.  It's a total minefield!</li>
            <li>The good thing is that they don't tend to bury it all that deep.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Fresh Litter</h2>
    <p>If the box starts to get low on litter, there's a bag in the hall closet.  Be advised that the litter is very dusty and you may want to 
        avoid breathing it in.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips 'n' Tricks:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I find that tilting the whole box toward the heater-facing side first makes the upper left pee zone easy to get.</li>
        <li>It will also help cover more of the unburied pee in the heater-side of the box.</li>
        <li>Tilting the whole box away from the heater-facing side will then expose the other pee zone and make that easier to get
            before moving on to the poops.
        </li>
        <li>(I have found that scooping the pee zones first will avoid breaking up the clumps while searching for poops.)</li>
    </ul>
